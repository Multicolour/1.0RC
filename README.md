Multicolour is a REST API generator geared towards super fast, secure by default and strongly typed development empowering you; the developer, to create amazingly fast and flexible apps, games and websites super fast and exactly how you want.

This repo is under *heavy* development as I am building Multicolour from scratch adding features you asked for, removing libraries that have been a constant headache and improving the usefulness of the entire lib.

Start by running `npm i -G multicolour` then you can start your API development with `multicolour init .`, in your desired working folder to start the wizard.
